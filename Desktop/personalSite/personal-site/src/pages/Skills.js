                            Hello! My name is Mirayna Mckinney. I am in my 3rd and final year in my pursuit of a Bachelor's in Linguistics and Computer Science Major from UCLA.
                            I have always been fascinated with communication, the behind-the-sceens of computers and programs, and the combination of the two.
                            {"\n"}{"\n"}
                            When it comes to Computer Science, I am most interested in
                            web and app development and NLPs, but I am open to trying my hand in all fields.
                            {"\n"}{"\n"}
                            I am experienced with Node.js, React.js, Flutter, Git, C++, Python,
                            Java and more (check out my Skills page).
                            {"\n"}{"\n"}
                            I spend my free time working on applications I've had ideas for or other projects. Outside the world of computers, I love running, snowboarding, playing soccer and playing guitar.
